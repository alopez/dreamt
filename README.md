Welcome to DREAMT
=================
**Decoding, Reranking, Evaluation, and Alignment for Machine Translation**

DREAMT consists of four baseline components for the open-ended assignments
posted at [the DREAMT website](http://alopez.github.io/dreamt), which is
kept in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

1. The ALIGNER takes parallel texts and produces word alignments.
2. The DECODER takes source sentences and produce output translations.
3. The RERANKER takes output translations and produces a new ranking of them.
4. The EVALUATOR takes output translations and scores them against references.
