  <h1>About DREAMT</h1>
</div>

We wrote DREAMT as a teaching aid for our 
[graduate class in machine translation](http://mt-class.org). 
To learn more about why we wrote it and how we use it, you can:

* Read [the paper](https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q/Q13/Q13-1014.pdf) that we published in the [Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.transacl.org/) (TACL) in 2013.

* Watch [the talk](http://webcasterms1.isi.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=ea55185170054e13972a0ea5b932eb6c1d)
  that Adam Lopez gave about DREAMT in the Information Sciences Institute's artificial intelligence seminar. 
  You can also browse [the talk slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7cpo43vOGF1c1pkb29vM0l5b1U/view?usp=sharing).

* View [the poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7cpo43vOGF1bXhBUXY3Tlg3Qms/view?usp=sharing) about DREAMT that was presented at the
  annual meeting of the [Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)](http://www.acl2013.org/site/) in 2013.
